# v1.1.0
Some adjustments and fixes:
- Role Colors Everywhere should now work properly on the user popout. This resolves [pull #1](https://github.com/Discord-Theme-Addons/amazing-activity-cards/pull/1).
- Added some more variables for the ability to customize more colors.
- Removed some unnecessary classes and added some to make it a bit more specific (just incase).
- BetterDiscord and Web versions now use a compiled source instead, ths is more reliable for updates and such.
- Some file structure reconstruction.
